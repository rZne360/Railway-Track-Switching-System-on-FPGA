Algorithm for Railway Track Switching System:
1. Start the system.
2. If reset is active, set switch1 = 0 and switch2 = 0.
3. Read sensor1 and sensor2 inputs.
4. If sensor1=1 and sensor2=0, set switch1=1 and switch2=0.
5. If sensor1=0 and sensor2=1, set switch1=0 and switch2=1.
6. If both sensors are 0, set both switches to 0.
7. Repeat process continuously.
