In this project, a Railway Track Switching System was designed and implemented on a Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA using Verilog HDL in Xilinx ISE. The design reads input from track sensors and controls two output switches to route trains appropriately. The implementation ensures real-time switching with synchronous logic, making it reliable for embedded railway applications. A testbench was developed to verify functionality before hardware deployment.
